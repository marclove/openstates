The Sunlight OpenStates API is a live JSON API for the people and work of Congress, provided by the Sunlight Foundation.

## Installation

    $ gem install sunlight-openstates

## Authentication

All requests to the OpenStates API require a Sunlight API key. An API key is free to register and has no usage limits.

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
